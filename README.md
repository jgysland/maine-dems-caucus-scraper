## Maine Dems Caucus Scraper
A friend wanted to not have to copy and paste a bunch of stuff from a bunch of Google Docs inside a bunch of links. And then have to do it all over again if some of the information changed. This is reasonable, and easily script-able. So the code is for example / reference, the data is the output when it was last run.

IPython Notebook viewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jgysland/maine-dems-caucus-scraper/blob/master/maine-caucus-locations-times.ipynb).

## Play Along At Home

1. Have Python 2.7 and Jupyter installed. 
2. Clone this repo, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the code in the notebook.
3. ??? (win at caucusing?)
4. Profit!!!
