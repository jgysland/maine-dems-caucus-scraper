## Maine Dems Caucus Scraper
A friend wanted to not have to copy and paste a bunch of stuff from a bunch of Google Docs inside a bunch of links. And then have to do it all over again if some of the information changed. This is reasonable, and easily script-able. So the code is for example / reference, the data is the output when it was last run.
